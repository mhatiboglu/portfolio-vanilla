## Normalize.css

“Normalize.css is a small CSS file that provides better cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements."

    The aims of normalize.css are as follows:

      -  Preserve useful browser defaults rather than erasing them.
      -  Normalize styles for a wide range of HTML elements.
      -  Correct bugs and common browser inconsistencies.
      -  Improve usability with subtle improvements.
      -  Explain the code using comments and detailed documentation.
